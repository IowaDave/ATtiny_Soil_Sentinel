# Why Not Use an Arduino?
I saw four reasons to use an AVR microcontroller, rather than full-featured Arduino development board.
1. **Cost**. A microcontroller chip typically costs less to buy compared to an Arduino.
2. **Size**. A chip takes up less space than an Arduino. Some AVR chips are *really* tiny, yet do the job.
3. **Energy savings**. Power-down sleep can cut a chip's battery drain almost to zero. An Arduino will continue to draw significant power even while the chip onboard of it is sleeping.
4. **Try something new**. Because I'm not getting any younger!
