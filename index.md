# Building the ATtiny Soil Sensor
An "Arduino" project without the Arduino!

The web serves up many examples where an Arduino is used to check a soil moisture sensor and flash an LED when things get too dry. 

I wondered: how much could I learn to do the same project with only a &ldquo;bare&rdquo; microcontroller, such as an ATmega328P pried loose from an Arduino Uno? Better yet, with one of the ATtiny chips instead! A lot, as it turned out. 

Now I'm writing it up. You can read the following articles in any order you choose:
